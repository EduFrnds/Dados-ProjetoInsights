# Insight Project
Project brings a very practical and intuitive approach, applying knowledge acquired during the Data Science course at ALURA school.

The objective of an Insight project is, through a business problem, to identify the root cause of the problem, collect data, including treatment, in addition to raising hypotheses about the behavior of the business in question.

Finally, an exploratory analysis must lead the studies in order to validate the hypotheses raised, and the solution proposal as insight must be the conclusive phase of this project.
